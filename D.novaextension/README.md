# D Syntax For [Nova][1]
**D** provides syntax highlighting and folding for the [**D**][1] Programming langage.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/staysail/nova-d/main/screenshot.png)

## Language Support

At present not every aspect of the syntax is highlighted, but
the use of a complete Tree Sitter grammar ensures that we have
all of the elements.

Language server support will add additional capabilities in the future.

## Required

This extension only supports Nova 10.
